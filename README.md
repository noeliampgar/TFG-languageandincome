 <br />
The steps followed and their correponding code is described here below:  <br />
 <br />



*1st step: Download of tweets including coordinates*

This step is not associated with any notebooks as this data was provided at the beginning of the project. <br />

 <br />

*2nd step: Search and incorporation of addresses*

-Link of addresses with tweets using given coordinates

-Incorporation of addresses to users

Associated with adddirs.ipynb. <br />


 <br />
*3rd step: Income search and addition*

-Raw income search and addition

-Income processing and CSV creation

Associated with ElPaisWidgetV4.ipynb. and rawrenta_to_renta.ipynb. <br />
 <br />


*4th step: Users selection*

This step is not associated with any notebooks because it was developed manually in a spreadsheet. <br />

 <br />
*5th step: Download of tweets written by selected users*

This step is not associated with any notebooks because it did not involve any Python coding. <br />
 <br />

*6th step: Language analysis, machine learning and search of common patterns*

Associated with generaFeatures_v10.ipynb, es.dic, datoscompletos.ipynb and ml_v2.ipynb.
